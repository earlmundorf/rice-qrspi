# Stage 3 — Design (interactive — DEV GATE 1)

**Input:** `ticket.md` + `research.md`.
**Output:** `design.md` (~200 lines max).

## Instructions

1. Read both inputs fully.
2. **You MUST present questions and wait for answers BEFORE writing any design document.**
   This is structural, not optional. Present 2-5 design decisions as options:
   `Q1: Discount evaluation — (A) new strategy bean, (B) extend DefaultX, (C) interceptor. Recommend A because …`
3. Walk through the draft assumptions from `ticket.md` one by one: confirmed by research /
   contradicted (cite file:line) / still open. Open assumptions must be resolved by the
   developer or explicitly accepted as risks.
4. After answers, write `design.md` with exactly these sections:
   - **Current state** (facts from research, file:line)
   - **Desired end state** (observable behavior, not implementation)
   - **Design decisions** (each Q with chosen option and why)
   - **Confirmed assumptions & accepted risks**
   - **Success criteria** — split into *Automated* (verification verbs/commands, tests
     that must pass) and *Manual* (checks appropriate to the stack — UI route/viewport,
     admin console path, API endpoint response — defined by the repo's profile; say who
     verifies)
   - **Out of scope**
5. If the developer's answers reveal missing research, stop and route back:
   `Re-run /cq:1_ticket to add questions, then /cq:2_research.`
6. Present `design.md` for approval; iterate until approved.
7. End by printing: `Next: /cq:4_structure working-docs/<TICKET-KEY>/ — run in a FRESH session.`

## Do not

- Write design.md before the Q&A exchange has happened.
- Include code, file-by-file changes, or task lists — that is stages 4-5.
- Pick a legacy pattern when research shows the team has a newer one; surface both and ask.
