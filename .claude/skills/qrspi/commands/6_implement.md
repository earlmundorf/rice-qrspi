# Stage 6 — Implement

**Input:** `structure.md` + `plan.md`. **Mode is explicit:** `mode=dev` or `mode=claude`.
If not given, ask — never assume.

## mode=dev — developer writes the code

1. Act as pair: answer questions grounded in `research.md`/`design.md`, review diffs on
   request, run verification commands when asked.
2. After each slice the developer completes, update `plan.md` checkboxes and confirm the
   slice checkpoint passed.
3. Never write implementation code unless the developer asks for a specific task.

## mode=claude — Claude executes the plan

1. Work slice by slice, in order. One fresh subagent per slice; it reads only its slice's
   tasks, relevant research summary, and prior slice outputs.
2. For each task: implement → run the task's verification (verbs resolved via
   `working-docs/config.json`; `MANUAL:` verbs mean print instructions and wait for the
   developer to confirm) → if it fails, diagnose and fix, re-verify; **never skip or
   proceed on red**.
3. Commit once per completed slice (conventional message referencing the ticket key).
   Check off tasks in `plan.md` as completed.
4. If the plan can't be followed (expected vs. actual mismatch), STOP. Present the
   mismatch and ask. Fundamental issue → route back: `Re-run /cq:5_plan (or 3_design).`
5. Optional: offer `git worktree` isolation before starting if the branch is shared.

## Both modes

- Resume support: on start, read checkboxes; trust completed checkmarks, start at the
  first unchecked task.
- Never push to remote, deploy, or modify any path in `protectedPaths`
  (`working-docs/config.json`); never commit `.env` or secrets.
- End by printing: `Next: /cq:7_validate working-docs/<TICKET-KEY>/ — run in a FRESH session.`
