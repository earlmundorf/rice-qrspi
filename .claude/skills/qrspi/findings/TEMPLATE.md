## What happened

_One or two sentences, plain English. What did the workflow or the codebase do that the
next ticket should know?_

## Context

_Enough to recognize it next time: which stage, which files/commands, which ticket area._

## The fix / the knowledge

_For a workflow finding: the concrete stage-command or config change.
For a project-knowledge finding: the fact and where it bit (file:line, command, log line)._

## Why this generalizes

_Why it's worth promoting rather than leaving as a one-off. If it doesn't generalize,
say so and mark `status: project-specific` so promotion review skips it._

## Promotion suggestion

_Exactly what to change in `promotion_target`. Leave blank if it needs a second
ticket to confirm._
