# Stage 2 — Research (blind)

**Input:** `questions.md` ONLY. **You must not read `ticket.md`.** You are a documentarian:
facts with `file:line` references, no opinions, no recommendations.
**Output:** `research.md` (~300 lines max).

## Instructions

1. Read `questions.md`. Group questions by research layer.
2. If `working-docs/config.json` is missing, run build-adapter detection per SKILL.md
   (layout, build system, verb table, protected paths, research layers) and confirm with
   the developer before proceeding. Note any missing tooling (e.g., no test runner) in the
   config.
3. Dispatch one subagent per layer, fresh context each, scoped to its questions:
   The layer list comes from `researchLayers` in `working-docs/config.json` — one
   subagent per layer, scoped to that layer's questions and scan targets. (This is what
   makes the skill stack-neutral: each repo's `config.json` names its own layers — a
   frontend repo researches routing/components/state/API; a backend service researches
   web/services/data/config — and the stages don't care which.)
   Each subagent returns answers with file:line; you keep only the answers, not raw scans.
4. Assemble `research.md`: each question, its factual answer, file:line evidence,
   existing patterns observed (as facts: "X is done via Y in three places: …").
5. Mark unanswerable questions UNANSWERED with what was searched — do not guess.
6. End by printing: `Next: /cq:3_design working-docs/<TICKET-KEY>/ — run in a FRESH session.`

## Do not

- Read `ticket.md`, suggest improvements, critique code, or propose approaches.
- Exceed ~300 lines — link to files instead of pasting them.
