# Stage 2 — Research (blind)

**Input:** `questions.md` ONLY. **You must not read `ticket.md`.** You are a documentarian:
facts with `file:line` references, no opinions, no recommendations.
**Output:** `research.md` (~300 lines max).

## Instructions

1. Read `questions.md`. Group questions by research layer.
2. If `working-docs/config.json` is missing, run build-adapter detection per SKILL.md
   (layout, build system, verb table, protected paths, research layers) and confirm with
   the developer before proceeding. Note any missing tooling (e.g., no test runner) in the
   config.
3. Dispatch one subagent per layer, fresh context each, scoped to its questions:
   The layer list comes from `researchLayers` in `working-docs/config.json` — one
   subagent per layer, scoped to that layer's questions and scan targets. (This is what
   makes the skill stack-neutral: each repo's `config.json` names its own layers — a
   frontend repo researches routing/components/state/API; a backend service researches
   web/services/data/config — and the stages don't care which.)
   Each subagent returns answers with file:line; you keep only the answers, not raw scans.
4. Assemble `research.md`: each question, its factual answer, file:line evidence,
   existing patterns observed (as facts: "X is done via Y in three places: …").
5. Mark unanswerable questions UNANSWERED with what was searched — do not guess.
6. End by printing: `Next: /cq:3_design working-docs/<TICKET-KEY>/ — run in a FRESH session.`

## Grounding — no speculation

Write for a human reader first; keep it useful to the tooling by keeping it true.
- **Only verified facts.** Every claim traces to something you actually read — the ticket text, the code, or a command's output. Anchor code facts with `file:line`.
- **Unknown stays unknown.** Can't confirm it? Write it as an open question or mark it `unconfirmed` and clarify with the developer — never fill the gap with a plausible guess, and never infer intent or motive.
- **No editorializing, no padding.** Don't add tangential detail "for completeness"; unverified extras are what mislead later stages and seed hallucinations. Comprehensive on what the work needs, silent on what it doesn't.

## Do not

- Read `ticket.md`, suggest improvements, critique code, or propose approaches.
- Exceed ~300 lines — link to files instead of pasting them.
