# Stage 5 — Plan (tactical; spot-check only)

**Input:** all artifacts in the task directory.
**Output:** `plan.md` with checkboxes. Alignment already happened in stages 3-4 — the
developer only spot-checks this document.

## Instructions

1. Expand each slice from `structure.md` into ordered tasks. Each task:
   - `- [ ]` checkbox, imperative title
   - Exact file paths to create/modify
   - Specific change description (signatures, interfaces, bean wiring, config/data entries
     — not prose essays)
   - Verification: the slice checkpoint's verbs resolved to concrete commands from
     `working-docs/config.json` (or `MANUAL:` instructions where so configured)
2. Respect the repo's CLAUDE.md conventions — they are authoritative over this list:
   the designated boundary layer (`apiBoundary` in config — no I/O bypassing it), typed
   responses, loading + error states, naming/structure patterns, and the `protectedPaths`
   in config (never touch generated/vendored/OOTB trees).
3. Final task is always **Documentation**: distill research into permanent flow docs
   (`context.md`, `components.md`, `diagram.md`).
4. Jira handling per `jira.mode` in config — never create Epics, Stories, or sub-tasks;
   the ticket the developer started with is the only Jira artifact:
   - `mcp`: attach the plan summary (and design/structure links) as a ticket comment.
   - `manual`: append the same comment as paste-ready text to
     `working-docs/<TICKET-KEY>/jira-updates.md` and tell the developer it's there.
   - `none`: skip.
5. Checkboxes are the resume mechanism — a fresh session reads them to continue.
6. End by printing:
   `Next: /cq:6_implement working-docs/<TICKET-KEY>/ mode=dev|claude — run in a FRESH session.`

## Do not

- Introduce tasks not traceable to a slice.
- Re-litigate design decisions; if a fundamental problem appears, route back to stage 3/4.
